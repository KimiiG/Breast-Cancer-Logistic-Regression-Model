# Breast-Cancer-Logistic-Regression-Model
This is a Breast Cancer Logistic Regression Model trained on a breast cancer dataset taken from Kaggle. The Diagnosis Column is the dependent variable or the outcome variable and it can take two values. They are M and B, which stand for Malignant(Cancer) or Benign(Non-Cancerous). The classification accuracy was relatively high, which means that the model successfully learned the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable.
